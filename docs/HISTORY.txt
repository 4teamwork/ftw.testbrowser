Changelog
=========


1.4.0 (2013-12-27)
------------------

- Deprecate `normalized_text` method, replace it with `text` property.
  The `text` property is more intuitive and easier to remember.
  The `text` property has almost the same result as `normalized_text`,
  but it represents `<br/>` and `<p>` with single and double newlines respectively.
  `text` is to be the lxml `text` property, which contained the raw, non-recursive
  text of the current node and is now available as `raw_text` property.
